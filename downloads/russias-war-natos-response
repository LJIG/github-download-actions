While it seems unlikely that either country will become a full member of the Alliance anytime soon, Russia\u0026rsquo;s actions have changed many long-standing assumptions in European security.

At an extraordinary and virtual summit on 25 February, Allied heads of state \u003ca rel=\u0022noopener noreferrer\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_192489.htm\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003edeclared\u003c/a\u003e that Russia had \u0026lsquo;walked away from its commitments under the Act\u0026rsquo;. The next step would be to declare it and all its provisions terminated, including renouncing NATO\u0026rsquo;s three \u0026lsquo;no\u0026rsquo;s\u0026nbsp; \u0026ndash; \u0026lsquo;no intention, no plan and no reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; and the pledge not to create new permanent bases with substantial combat forces. Russia \u003ca rel=\u0022noopener noreferrer\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=962\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003epledged similar restraint\u003c/a\u003e at the signing, and again in 1999, but has not honoured these promises.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nNATO\u0026rsquo;s leadership will also be faced with the question as to whether it too should revitalise its integrated conventional nuclear-missile defence deterrent. The separation of conventional and nuclear exercises, NATO policy since the end of the Cold War, would need to be rescinded in these circumstances. The Alliance would also need to consider developing more credible nuclear forces, including enhanced readiness levels, higher numbers of dual-capable aircraft (DCA), the hardening of aircraft shelters, and potential dispersion plans to non-DCA states\u0026rsquo; airfields. Indeed, new deterrent options, such as stand-off nuclear-armed cruise missiles, will present a far more credible option than free-fall bombs.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nCritically, the issue of how to integrate France\u0026acute;s nuclear deterrent into a comprehensive European nuclear deterrent will likely soon appear on NATO\u0026rsquo;s agenda. The impending German decision on its DCA replacement \u0026ndash; a fourth-generation F-18 system with a complicated, lengthy certification process, a fourth-generation Eurofighter, or a fifth-generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter chosen by all of its DCA partners \u0026ndash; will be critical to enhance or weaken Berlin\u0026rsquo;s contribution to this strategy. Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.dw.com/en/german-chancellor-holds-speech-on-russian-invasion-of-ukraine/av-60934505\u0022 target=\u0022_self\u0022\u003ehistoric speech\u003c/a\u003e on 26 February pledging to spend \u0026euro;100 billion to fulfil Germany\u0026rsquo;s defence commitments is important in this regard.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eMore credible conventional forces\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h4\u003e\nSimultaneously, NATO will also need more credible conventional forces to maintain deterrence, including a permanent forward deployment on the eastern flank. This is particularly true for land forces, where the major European NATO members have particularly failed to meet their commitments. The \u003ca rel=\u0022noopener noreferrer\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.politico.eu/article/i-am-pissed-off-chief-of-the-german-army-alfons-mais-states/#:~:text=Senior%20army%20official%20says%20Germany\u0027s,its%20allies%20are%20extremely%20limited.\u0026amp;text=BERLIN%20%E2%80%94%20Alfons%20Mais%2C%20the%20chief,a%20Russian%20invasion%20of%20Ukraine.\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003epublic admission\u003c/a\u003e by the German Chief of Army that Germany\u0026rsquo;s land forces are \u0026lsquo;more or less bare\u0026rsquo; is a case in point. Scholz\u0026rsquo;s promise to fulfil Germany\u0026rsquo;s NATO pledge to spend 2% of GDP on defence can address this shortfall, if the money is allocated and spent in a considered manner. But the British Army faces a similar dilemma, and so too does France. Russia\u0026rsquo;s war on Ukraine has demonstrated that large, heavy mechanised systems remain key to seizing and holding territory in continental Europe \u0026ndash; and NATO Allies must face this enduring reality.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nInvesting in conventional deep-strike options would offer NATO members greater scope to complicate Russian military planning. These would include the acquisition and deployment of significant numbers of mobile ground-launched ballistic missiles, ground-launched cruise missiles, as well as air- and ship-launched cruise missiles. Moreover, NATO Allies will need to address long-standing shortfalls in areas such as mobile air defences, air radars and cruise-missile detection. As part of this, NATO will need to review its self-imposed restrictions on missile defences, which thus far are not meant to target\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;Russia\u0026rsquo;s systems. NATO should consider building sufficient capabilities to be able to defend critical European military infrastructure (such as THAAD or Patriot batteries) \u0026ndash; as the early phase of combat in Ukraine has shown\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;. Finally, Allies will likely need a broad and well-funded programme to improve sustainability and logistics for major operations in the entire area of NATO operations.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eOther instruments of power\u003c/h4\u003e\nRussia\u0026rsquo;s campaign goes beyond the military realm, taking in political warfare too. And just as it will need to consider adapting its strategy and force structure, NATO will also need to adopt different mechanisms to coordinate non-military instruments of power. The current practice whereby individual Allies seek support for such instruments through the European Union and other bodies, or contribute to national capabilities, is insufficient.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nDuring the Cold War, NATO members coordinated on the use of economic instruments of power in other bodies to achieve political aims, in a coherent manner with the Alliance\u0026rsquo;s military instrument of power. Allies will likely need to work harder to agree to such measures among themselves, and then use other bodies, such as the European Union, to implement them in coordination with partners. This is not to say that the competencies or power of the EU should be reduced, nor to take away from the remarkable unity they have shown in the current crisis. But an early lesson from this crisis has been that it would be useful for the NATO Secretary General to have fully integrated military and non-military instruments of power to deal with crises.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nRussia\u0026rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine is a watershed moment for European security. Moscow has moved the geostrategic goalposts and is now more than ever a direct threat to NATO\u0026rsquo;s eastern Allies. In response, the Alliance needs to prepare for a new Cold War in Europe, however uncomfortable that reality might be for some European capitals.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e","className":"richtext reading--content font-secondary"}), document.getElementById("react_02WnAwpUQ0WHYiF3j0pvQ"))});</script>
